## 🔍 CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. **Scale of Impact**
- **15,061 potential active users** would not be engaged in November
- **$2M+ in transaction volume** at risk
- Impact split nearly evenly between BWS (49%) and Petbarn (51%)

### 2. **MyNRMA Funding Stop & BWS Impact**
💼 **MyNRMA partnership details:**
- BWS is a major MyNRMA merchant (97% of users from MyNRMA/non-ING networks)
- MyNRMA stopped funding BWS mid-October 2025
- Pre-funding-stop (May-Aug): 7,409 avg users
- During transition (Sept-Oct): 7,999 avg users (maintained momentum)
- This shows **stable performance** until funding actually stopped

**Implication:**
- BWS maintained user base through October despite funding stop announcement
- November pause is direct result of MyNRMA funding withdrawal
- Strong merchant performance independent of ING

### 3. **Petbarn ING Partnership Impact**
🤝 **ING partnership transformation:**
- **ING partnership started:** Late August 2025
- **September = First full month:** 10,608 users (95% from ING)
- **Bill shock impact:** Unexpected costs absorbed by Pokitpal
- **October pause:** Petbarn paused offers → dropped to 3,633 users
- **95% ING dependency:** Only 357 users from non-ING networks
- **Volatility (62.7% CV):** Driven by rapid ING partnership ramp-up

**Root cause identified:** Not a "mystery spike" - it's ING's first full month of operation

### 4. **Revenue Concentration**
- **BWS:** $3.7M total spend (52.6% of combined)
- **Petbarn:** $3.3M total spend (47.4% of combined)
- **Combined 6-month volume:** $7,032,404

### 5. **User Behavior Differences**

| Metric | BWS | Petbarn |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Avg Transaction Value | $48.17 | $128.59 |
| Transactions per User | 2.51 | 1.13 |
| Spend per User | $120.04 | $146.30 |

**Insight:** Petbarn users spend more per transaction but transact less frequently

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS & CONFIDENCE LEVELS

### Data Limitations
- ✅ **Complete:** July-October 2025 data appears robust
- ⚠️ **Limited:** May-June 2025 data not visible in analysis
- ❌ **Missing:** November actual performance (pause impact)

### Assumptions
- All merchant variants captured via keyword matching (BWS, Petbarn)
- User uniqueness maintained across variants
- Transaction data complete and accurate
- Linear trends reasonable for 1-month projection
- No external factors (market shifts, competitor actions)

### Confidence Assessment

| Merchant | Projection Confidence | Rationale |
|----------|----------------------|-----------|
| **BWS** | 🟡 **MODERATE** | Stable data but contradictory pause narrative |
| **Petbarn** | 🟠 **LOW-MODERATE** | High volatility, unexplained September spike |
| **Overall** | 🟡 **MODERATE** | Directionally correct, magnitude uncertain |

## 🔬 VOX-ING USER NETWORK EXCLUSION ANALYSIS

**Question:** Does the VOX-ING user network affect these numbers?

**Answer:** **YES - MASSIVELY!** VOX-ING network accounts for **50% of users** and **54% of spend**!

### 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING

VOX-ING is a **USER NETWORK** (not a merchant), and it represents the **single largest driver** of the Petbarn impact.

| Analysis | With VOX-ING Network | Without VOX-ING Network | VOX-ING Contribution | % Impact |
|----------|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **BWS Projected Users** | 7,409 | 7,169 | 239 | **3.2%** |
| **BWS Projected Spend** | $889,334 | $865,860 | $23,474 | **2.6%** |
| **Petbarn Projected Users** | 7,652 | 357 | 7,294 | **95.3%** |
| **Petbarn Projected Spend** | $1,119,777 | $53,898 | $1,065,879 | **95.2%** |
| **TOTAL Projected Users** | **15,061** | **7,527** | **7,534** | **50.0%** |
| **TOTAL Projected Spend** | **$2,009,111** | **$919,758** | **$1,089,353** | **54.2%** |

### 💡 Key Insights

#### 1. **Petbarn is VOX-ING Dominated**
- **95.3% of Petbarn projected users** are from VOX-ING network
- Only **357 users** would be impacted if VOX-ING network is excluded
- **Petbarn's growth is almost entirely driven by VOX-ING users**

#### 2. **BWS is Minimally Affected by VOX-ING**
- Only **3.2% of BWS users** are from VOX-ING network
- BWS core audience remains strong across other networks
- **7,169 users** still impacted without VOX-ING

#### 3. **Total Impact Changes Dramatically**
- **WITH VOX-ING:** 15,061 users, $2.0M spend
- **WITHOUT VOX-ING:** 7,527 users, $920K spend
- **VOX-ING users represent HALF of the total impact**

### 📊 Monthly Performance Comparison

#### BWS (Relatively Stable)
| Month | With VOX-ING | Without VOX-ING | VOX-ING Users |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| July | 7,196 | 6,978 | 218 (3.0%) |
| August | 7,622 | 7,361 | 261 (3.4%) |
| September | 8,572 | 8,426 | 146 (1.7%) |
| October | 7,426 | 7,358 | 68 (0.9%) |

#### Petbarn (VOX-ING Dominated!)
| Month | With VOX-ING | Without VOX-ING | VOX-ING Users |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| July | 2,570 | 526 | **2,044 (79.5%)** |
| August | 5,968 | 590 | **5,378 (90.1%)** |
| September | 10,608 | 679 | **9,929 (93.6%)** |
| October | 3,633 | 281 | **3,352 (92.3%)** |

### 🎯 Strategic Implications

#### **If VOX-ING Network Remains Active:**
- Core impact: **7,527 users** ($920K)
- Focus on BWS (7,169 users) and small Petbarn base (357 users)
- **Much smaller reactivation effort needed**

#### **If VOX-ING Network Also Pauses:**
- Full impact: **15,061 users** ($2.0M)
- Requires coordination with VOX-ING partnership
- **Petbarn reactivation almost entirely dependent on VOX-ING**

### ⚠️ Critical Questions

1. **What is VOX-ING's relationship with Petbarn?**
   - Partnership agreement?
   - Exclusive or preferred offers?
   - Why such extreme concentration?

2. **Is the September Petbarn spike VOX-ING driven?**
   - September: 9,929 VOX-ING users out of 10,608 total (93.6%)
   - **YES - The spike is almost entirely VOX-ING users**

3. **What are VOX-ING user economics?**
   - VOX-ING Petbarn users spend: $146/user (historical)
   - Non-VOX Petbarn users spend: $151/user (historical)
   - Similar economics but **drastically different volume**

### 📌 Bottom Line

**The 15,061 user number is misleading without context:**
- **7,527 users (50%)** are from non-VOX-ING networks
- **7,534 users (50%)** are from VOX-ING network
- **Petbarn is 95% VOX-ING dependent**
- **BWS is 97% non-VOX-ING (independent)**

**Decision framework depends entirely on VOX-ING network status.**
