# 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: VOX-ING NETWORK IMPACT ANALYSIS
## BWS & Petbarn Offer Pause - Executive Summary

**Report Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Status:** ⚠️ **ING PARTNERSHIP IMPACT & FUNDING PAUSE ANALYSIS**

---

## 📋 CONTEXT & BACKGROUND

### **What Happened:**

**Petbarn (ING Merchant):**
- **Late August 2025:** ING partnership started with Pokitpal
- **September 2025:** First full month of ING → 10,608 users (massive spike)
- **Bill Shock:** Petbarn saw unexpected costs, Pokitpal absorbed the impact
- **October 2025:** Petbarn paused offers due to bill shock → 3,633 users (66% drop)
- **November 2025:** Offers remain paused

**BWS (MyNRMA Merchant):**
- **Pre-October:** Strong MyNRMA merchant, stable 7,000-8,000 users
- **Mid-October 2025:** MyNRMA stopped funding BWS offers
- **Result:** BWS offers paused/reduced

### **The Question:**
*"If BWS and Petbarn had NOT paused their offers in November 2025, how many active users could they have added?"*

**Why WITH/WITHOUT ING matters:** Petbarn numbers are heavily ING-skewed (95%), while BWS is MyNRMA-driven (non-ING).

### **The Complete Answer:**

## 🎯 IT DEPENDS ON VOX-ING NETWORK STATUS

| Scenario | Projected Users | Estimated Spend | Who's Affected |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Scenario A: VOX-ING Network Active** | **7,527** | **$919,758** | BWS (95%) + Small Petbarn base (5%) |
| **Scenario B: VOX-ING Network Also Paused** | **15,061** | **$2,009,111** | BWS (49%) + VOX-dependent Petbarn (51%) |

### **VOX-ING Network Contribution:** 7,534 users (50%) and $1,089,353 (54%)

## 🎯 STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Priority 1: ING Partnership Economics Resolution

**URGENT ACTIONS:**
1. **Resolve Petbarn bill shock issue** - Negotiate sustainable economics with Petbarn + ING
2. **Define cost-sharing model** - Who absorbs growth costs (Pokitpal vs Merchant vs ING)?
3. **Set volume/spend caps** - Prevent future bill shock scenarios
4. **Restart framework** - Controlled ramp-up instead of full activation

### Priority 2: Scenario Planning & Decision Framework

#### **Scenario A: ING Partnership Continues (Preferred)**
- **Impact:** Up to 15,061 users, $2.0M (if both restart)
- **Petbarn with ING:** 7,652 projected users
- **BWS (if MyNRMA resumes):** 7,409 projected users
- **Strategy:** Negotiate controlled restart with both partners

#### **Scenario B: ING Partnership Paused / Petbarn Non-ING Only**
- **Impact:** 7,527 users, $920K
- **Petbarn without ING:** Only 357 users (minimal)
- **BWS (if MyNRMA resumes):** 7,169 projected users
- **Strategy:** Focus on MyNRMA BWS, rebuild Petbarn non-ING base

#### **Scenario C: Status Quo (Both Remain Paused)**
- **Impact:** Continued revenue loss
- **Risk:** Competitive disadvantage, user churn
- **Strategy:** Monitor and prepare for restart opportunities

### Priority 3: Partnership & Funding Management

**ING/Petbarn:**
1. **Cost predictability model** - Forecast monthly spend with buffers
2. **Phased restart plan** - Gradual ramp vs full activation
3. **Performance monitoring** - Daily tracking to avoid bill shock
4. **Alternative Petbarn networks** - Build non-ING base (currently only 357 users)

**MyNRMA/BWS:**
5. **Re-engagement with MyNRMA** - Negotiate funding restart
6. **Value proposition refresh** - Demonstrate ROI to MyNRMA
7. **Alternative funding** - Can Pokitpal subsidize temporarily?
8. **Network diversification** - Reduce MyNRMA dependency (currently 97%)
